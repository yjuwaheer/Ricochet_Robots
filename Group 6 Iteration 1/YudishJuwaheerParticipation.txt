I, Yudish Juwaheer, confirm that I participated in Iteration 1 of Ricochet Robots Project. I was responsible in completing the "Brief Use Cases" and "List of actors and their goals". After completion, feedback was given by my teammates to refine the work for final submission. I also helped in refining others' work through constructive feedback and formatted all documents before uploading to GitHub.
