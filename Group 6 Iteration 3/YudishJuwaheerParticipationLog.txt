I, Yudish Juwaheer, confirm that I participated in Iteration 3 of Ricochet Robots Project. I was responsible in completing the "Use Case Description: Score Validation" and "Sequence Diagram: Score Validation". After completion, feedback was given by my teammates to refine the work for final submission. I also coded most of the core structure for this iteration 3 and was assisted by Brianna.
