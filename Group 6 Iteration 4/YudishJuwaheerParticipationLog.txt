I, Yudish Juwaheer, confirm that I participated in Iteration 4 of Ricochet Robots Project. I was responsible in completing the "Network Design Document" and review the work of Brianna "Design Patterns". After completion, feedback was given by my teammates to refine the work for final submission. I also coded the Complex Board, ensure that game was working appropriately for 4 players and was assisted by Brianna for diagonal movement of robots.
