# The Ricochet Robots Project
Ricochet Robot is a board game for 2 or more people in which a player must
move a robot to its target in as few moves as possible. The game was first
published in Germany in 1999 as Rasende Roborter. The English version was
published by Rio Grande Game.

We attempted to recreate this board game with two types of pre-programmed
board (a Simple and a Complex Board). We managed to make the interface as
easy as possible to use and we also catered for possible vision-impaired
players.
